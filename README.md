# punk-back-device
A firmware and 3D models for creating a 4 button feedback device based on an ESP8266

## What you will be needing
* An ESP8266
* Four buttons (those tiny 6x6 ones)
* Two LEDs and proper resistors: 
** a red LED + 100 Ohm 
** a green LED + 68 Ohm
* The Arduino IDE (tested with 1.6.11) with ESP8266 board plugin (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
* A 3D-Printer or access to one
* Some cables (I use dupont jumper cables for easy wiring, you may also solder them)

## Diagrams to be available later
